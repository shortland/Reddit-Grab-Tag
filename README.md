# Reddit-Grab-Tag
Using Redditâ€™s API, the first script grabs the top posts from the defined subreddit. It seperates each post, and writes them into it's own file. The second script takes each file, grabs the necessary information (title, content, author) and inserts them into a database.

Can definetely use a JSON parser to do this ugly cropping and snipping work... I thought this'd be easier though.

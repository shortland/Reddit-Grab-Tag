# Reddit-Grab-Tag
Using Redditâ€™s API;

Working example: http://ilankleiman.com/newsfeed/fetch.pl

Grabs top 6 (can be changed) posts within the past 24 hours (can be changed) of a 1 or multiple subreddits.

After grabbing the page source, crops out each of the 6 posts into seperate files. 

Grabs out the title, content, and other variables from the post.
Inserts that information into the database so it can be more easily & quickly retrieved.

fetch.pl grabs that data and spits it all out in some simple html. (you're meant to change that to your liking)
